# TipTap Editor with Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS

This repository contains an example of how to use the [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) editor with vanilla JavaScript and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as an alternative to the React, Vue and Svelt examples provided by the TipTap documentation.

## Running

If you have [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) installed, run the following command to show the example:

```bash
yarn run serve
```

or

```bash
npm run serve
```

Otherwise, view `index.html` with any web server (such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)).
